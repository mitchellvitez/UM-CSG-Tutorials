# Airbus Maintenance

This tutorial is intended for webmasters. If you'd like to update airbus but aren't the webmaster, please contact the [CSG Webmaster](mailto:csg.webmaster@umich.edu)

This example will go over the fall break update period, so please adjust accordingly for other times

## Getting the username and password

First, ftp into the Airbus server at `/afs/umich.edu/group/a/airbus`. From now on, we'll refer to this as the `airbus` directory

Take a look at `airbus/Private/html/orms/lib`. There, you'll find a config file. Open it up, and poke around to find the username and password for the next step.
