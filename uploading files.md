# Uploading Files

This tutorial covers uploading a file to the CSG site, and putting a link to it on the site. The example we'll use will be posting a pdf of some assembly meeting minutes to the table of minutes at https://csg.umich.edu/legislative-branch/student-assembly/minutes

## Getting to the edit page
