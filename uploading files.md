# Uploading Files

This tutorial covers uploading a file to the CSG site, and putting a link to it on the site. The example we'll use will be posting a pdf of some assembly meeting minutes to the table of minutes at https://csg.umich.edu/legislative-branch/student-assembly/minutes

## Getting to the edit page

First, go to https://csg.umich.edu/legislative-branch/student-assembly/minutes in your browser. You need to be logged in to make changes, so make sure you see something like this at the top of the page

![Admin Bar](/images/uploading files/admin bar.png)

If you're not logged in, find the "login" link at the bottom of the page. If you are logged in, but don't have admin access, contact the [CSG Webmaster](mailto:csg.webmaster@umich.edu)

Finally, you should see something like

at the bottom of the page. Click "Edit".

## Uploading the file and linking to it

You should now be seeing something like

![Edit Page](/images/uploading files/edit page.png)

Find the place you want to insert your file link, and put your cursor there. Then click the link button ( <img src="/images/uploading files/link button.png" width="48" /> ) You'll see the link dialog

<img src="/images/uploading files/link dialog.png" width="400" />

Finally, just follow this series of steps to insert a link to your file:

* Click Browse Server
* Click upload <img src="/images/uploading files/upload.png" width="60" />
* Click Add files <img src="/images/uploading files/add files.png" width="60" /> and then add the file from your computer.
* Hit `ctrl-f` or `command-f` on a mac, search for your file name, and double click the file <img src="/images/uploading files/file.png" width="60" />
* Hit OK <img src="/images/uploading files/ok.png" width="60" /> in the link dialog, and your file should be on the server and have a link to it!
