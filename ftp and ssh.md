# Connecting to the CSG Site over FTP or SSH

Please use SFTP when transferring files to the CSG site

## FTP

Use [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) or another FTP program to

- connect to `/afs/umich.edu/group/u/umcsg/Private/html/files/files` if you're uploading a pdf or other downloadable file.

- connect to `/afs/umich.edu/group/u/umcsg/Private/html` for other CSG files

- connect to `/afs/umich.edu/group/a/airbus/Private/html` for Airbus-related files

## SSH

SSH into the same directories as above. You can also use [MFile](mfile.umich.edu) to edit the site, but it's not recommended.
